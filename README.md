First create a alchemy table!

![AlchemyTable](images/AlchemyTableRecipe.png)

Then make a alchemic jar

Now create a processor

![Processor](images/ProcessorRecipe.png)

An alchemy table needs 3 things:
- A Jar/Concoction
- A Base Ingridient
- A Bucket Of Elementium

To get elementium we need to process a water bucket with a fermented spider eye

You can put an alchemical concoction back into the alchemical table to get more effects or a stronger one.
Theres a limit of level 3 for most effects.

Process a sword with a concoction to apply the effects to the sword ( Entities player hits gets the effects )

You can wash sand with a washer to get gold nuggets , nautilus shells and duromale shells
