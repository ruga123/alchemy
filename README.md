Create potions dynamically using alchemy construct!

First create a alchemy table!

![AlchemyTable](images/AlchemyTableRecipe.png)

Then make a alchemic jar

Now create a processor

![Processor](images/ProcessorRecipe.png)

An alchemy table needs 3 things:
- A Jar/Concoction
- A Base Ingridient
- A Bucket Of Elementium

To get elementium we need to process a water bucket with a fermented spider eye

You can put an alchemical concoction back into the alchemical table to get more effects or a stronger one.
Theres a limit of level 3 for most effects.

Process a sword or an axe with a concoction to apply the effects to the sword ( Entities player hits gets the effects )
W.I.P
Collector:
Collects sap from logs ,used to prolong effects
